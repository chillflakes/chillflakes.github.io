> ## When You Are Old By William Butler Yeats
>  
> > When you are old and grey and full of sleep,\
> > And nodding by the fire, take down this book,\
> > And slowly read, and dream of the soft look\
> > Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;
> >  
> > How many loved your moments of glad grace,\
> > And loved your beauty with love false or true,\
> > But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,\
> > And loved the sorrows of your changing face;
> >  
> > And bending down beside the glowing bars,\
> > Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled\
> > And paced upon the mountains overhead\
> > And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.

> ## The New Colossus By Emma Lazarus
> 
> > Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\
> > With conquering limbs astride from land to land;\
> > Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\
> > A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\
> > Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name\
> > Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand\
> > Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command\
> > The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\
> > “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she\
> > With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,\
> > Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\
> > The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\
> > Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\
> > I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”

> ## Away by James Whitcomb Riley
> 
> > I cannot say and I will not say\
> > That she is dead, she is just away.\
> > With a cheery smile and a wave of hand\
> > She has wandered into an unknown land;\
> > And left us dreaming how very fair\
> > Its needs must be, since she lingers there.\
> > And you-oh you, who the wildest yearn\
> > From the old-time step and the glad return-\
> > Think of her faring on, as dear\
> > In the love of there, as the love of here\
> > Think of her still the same way, I say;\
> > She is not dead, she is just away.

> ## My Shadow By Robert Louis Stevenson
>  
> > I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,\
> > And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.\
> > He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;\
> > And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.
> >  
> > The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—\
> > Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;\
> > For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,\
> > And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.
> >  
> > He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,\
> > And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.\
> > He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;\
> > I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!
> >  
> > One morning, very early, before the sun was up,\
> > I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;\
> > But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,\
> > Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.

> ## I Am! by John Clare 
>  
> > I am! yet what I am none cares or knows,\
> > My friends forsake me like a memory lost;\
> > I am the self-consumer of my woes,\
> > They rise and vanish in oblivious host,\
> > Like shades in love and death’s oblivion lost;\
> > And yet I am! and live with shadows tost
> >  
> > Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,\
> > Into the living sea of waking dreams,\
> > Where there is neither sense of life nor joys,\
> > But the vast shipwreck of my life’s esteems;\
> > And e’en the dearest—that I loved the best—\
> > Are strange—nay, rather stranger than the rest.
> >  
> > I long for scenes where man has never trod;\
> > A place where woman never smil’d or wept;\
> > There to abide with my creator, God,\
> > And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept:\
> > Untroubling and untroubled where I lie;\
> > The grass below—above the vaulted sky.

> ## Lines Written in Early Spring by William Wordsworth 
>
> > I heard a thousand blended notes,\
> > While in a grove I sate reclined,\
> > In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts\
> > Bring sad thoughts to the mind.
> >  
> > To her fair works did nature link\
> > The human soul that through me ran;\
> > And much it grieved my heart to think\
> > What man has made of man.
> >  
> > Through primrose tufts, in that sweet bower,\
> > The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;\
> > And 'tis my faith that every flower\
> > Enjoys the air it breathes.
> >  
> > The birds around me hopped and played:\
> > Their thoughts I cannot measure,\
> > But the least motion which they made,\
> > It seemed a thrill of pleasure.
> >  
> > The budding twigs spread out their fan,\
> > To catch the breezy air;\
> > And I must think, do all I can,\
> > That there was pleasure there.
> >  
> > If this belief from heaven be sent,\
> > If such be Nature's holy plan,\
> > Have I not reason to lament\
> > What man has made of man?

> ## How Did You Die? by Edmund Vance Cooke
> 
> > Did you tackle that trouble that came your way\
> > With a resolute heart and cheerful?\
> > Or hide your face from the light of day\
> > With a craven soul and fearful?\
> > Oh, a trouble's a ton, or a trouble's an ounce,\
> > Or a trouble is what you make it,\
> > And it isn't the fact that you're hurt that counts,\
> > But only how did you take it?
> >
> > You are beaten to earth? Well, well, what's that?\
> > Come up with a smiling face.\
> > It's nothing against you to fall down flat,\
> > But to lie there -- that's disgrace.\
> > The harder you're thrown, why the higher you bounce;\
> > Be proud of your blackened eye!\
> > It isn't the fact that you're licked that counts,\
> > It's how did you fight --  and why?
> > 
> > And though you be done to the death, what then?\
> > If you battled the best you could,\
> > If you played your part in the world of men,\
> > Why, the Critic will call it good.\
> > Death comes with a crawl, or comes with a pounce,\
> > And whether he's slow or spry,\
> > It isn't the fact that you're dead that counts,\
> > But only how did you die?

> ## Swimmers by Louis Untermeyer
>  
> > I took the crazy short-cut to the bay;\
> > Over a fence or two and through a hedge,\
> > Jumping a private road, along the edge\
> > Of backyards full of drying wash it lay.\
> > I ran, electric with elation,\
> > Sweating, impetuous and wild\
> > For a swift plunge in the sea that smiled,\
> > Quiet and luring, half a mile away.\
> > This was the final thrill, the last sensation\
> > That capped four hours of violence and laughter:\
> > To have, with casual friends and casual jokes,\
> > Hard sport, a cold swim and fresh linen after …\
> > And now, the last set being played and over,\
> > I hurried past the ruddy lakes of clover;\
> > I swung my racket at astonished oaks,\
> > My arm still tingling from aggressive strokes.\
> > Tennis was over for the day—\
> > I took the leaping short-cut to the bay.
> >  
> > Then the swift plunge into the cool, green dark—\
> > The windy waters rushing past me, through me;\
> > Filled with a sense of some heroic lark,\
> > Exulting in a vigor clean and roomy.\
> > Swiftly I rose to meet the feline sea\
> > That sprang upon me with a hundred claws,\
> > And grappled, pulled me down and played with me.\
> > Then, tense and breathless in the tightening pause\
> > When one wave grows into a toppling acre,\
> > I dived headlong into the foremost breaker;\
> > Pitting against a cold and turbulent strife\
> > The feverish intensity of life.\
> > Out of the foam I lurched and rode the wave,\
> > Swimming, hand over hand, against the wind;\
> > I felt the sea's vain pounding, and I grinned\
> > Knowing I was its master, not its slave.\
> > Oh, the proud total of those lusty hours—\
> > The give and take of rough and vigorous tussles\
> > With happy sinews and rejoicing muscles;\
> > The knowledge of my own miraculous powers,\
> > Feeling the force in one small body bent\
> > To curb and tame this towering element.
> >  
> > Back on the curving beach I stood again,\
> > Facing the bath-house, when a group of men,\
> > Stumbling beneath some sort of weight, went by.\
> > I could not see the hidden thing they carried;\
> > I only heard: “He never gave a cry—”\
> > “Who's going to tell her?—” “Yes, and they just married—”\
> > “Such a good swimmer, too” … and then they passed;\
> > Leaving the silence throbbing and aghast.
> >  
> > *__A moment there my buoyant heart hung slack,\
> > And then the glad, barbaric blood came back\
> > Singing a livelier tune; and in my pulse\
> > Beat the great wave that surges and exults …\
> > Why I was there and whither I must go\
> > I did not care. Enough for me to know\
> > The same unresting struggle and the glowing\
> > Beauty of spendthrift-hours, bravely showing\
> > Life, an adventure perilous and gay;\
> > And Death, a long and vivid holiday.__*

> ## Ode on a Grecian Urn By John Keats
> 
> > Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,\
> >        Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,\
> > Sylvan historian, who canst thus express\
> >        A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:\

> >        Of deities or mortals, or of both,\
> >                In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?\
> >        What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?\

> ## A Character by William Wordsworth
>  
> > I marvel how Nature could ever find space\
> > For so many strange contrasts in one human face:\
> > There's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom\
> > And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom.
> >  
> > There's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain;\
> > Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain\
> > Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease,\
> > Would be rational peace—a philosopher's ease.
> >  
> > There's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds,\
> > And attention full ten times as much as there needs;\
> > Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy;\
> > And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy.
> >  
> > There's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare\
> > Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there,\
> > There's virtue, the title it surely may claim,\
> > Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name.
> >  
> > This picture from nature may seem to depart,\
> > Yet the Man would at once run away with your heart;\
> > And I for five centuries right gladly would be\
> > Such an odd such a kind happy creature as he.

> ## Remember by Christina Rossetti
>  
> > Remember me when I am gone away,\

> >       And afterwards remember, do not grieve:\
> >       For if the darkness and corruption leave\
> >       A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,\
> >   Better by far you should forget and smile\
> >       Than that you should remember and be sad.

> ## And Death Shall Have No Dominion by Dylan Thomas
>  
> > And death shall have no dominion.\

> > And death shall have no dominion.\
> > Under the windings of the sea\
> > They lying long shall not die windily;\
> > Twisting on racks when sinews give way,\
> > Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break;\
> > Faith in their hands shall snap in two,\
> > And the unicorn evils run them through;\
> > Split all ends up they shan't crack;\
> > And death shall have no dominion.
> >  
> > And death shall have no dominion.\
> > No more may gulls cry at their ears\
> > Or waves break loud on the seashores;\
> > Where blew a flower may a flower no more\
> > Lift its head to the blows of the rain;\
> > Though they be mad and dead as nails,\
> > Heads of the characters hammer through daisies;\
> > Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,\
> > And death shall have no dominion.

> ## I broke the spell that held me long by William Cullen Bryant
>  
> > I broke the spell that held me long,\

> > Its causes were around me yet?\

> > Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?\
> > And driven the Hamadryad from the wood\
> > To seek a shelter in some happier star?\
> > Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,\
> > The Elfin from the green grass, and from me\
> > The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?

> >  
> > Of the sick-room, the mortal strife,\
> > The turmoil for a little breath –\
> > The pure eternal course of life,\
> > Not human combatings with death.
> >  
> > Thus feeling, gazing, let me grow\
> > Composed, refreshed, ennobled, clear;\
> > Then willing let my spirit go\
> > To work or wait elsewhere or here!

> ## When I have fears by John Keats
>  
> > When I have fears that I may cease to be\
> > Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,\
> > Before high-piled books, in charactery,\
> > Hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain;
> >  
> > When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,\
> > Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,\
> > And think that I may never live to trace\
> > Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;
> >  
> > And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,\
> > That I shall never look upon thee more,\
> > Never have relish in the faery power\
> > Of unreflecting love;--then on the shore
> >  
> > Of the wide world I stand alone, and think\
> > Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.

> > Enclosed in woods profound.
> >  
> > Hark! how through many a melting note\

> ## The Charge of the Light Brigade by Alfred Lord Tennyson

> >  
> > *__The Charge of the Light Brigade__* was a failed military action involving the British light cavalry led by Lord Cardigan against Russian forces during the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854 in the Crimean War. Lord Raglan had intended to send the Light Brigade to prevent the Russians from removing captured guns from overrun Turkish positions, a task for which the light cavalry were well-suited. However, there was miscommunication in the chain of command and the Light Brigade was instead sent on a frontal assault against a different artillery battery, one well-prepared with excellent fields of defensive fire.
> > The Light Brigade reached the battery under withering direct fire and scattered some of the gunners, but they were forced to retreat immediately, and the assault ended with very high British casualties and no decisive gains.

> > When, soft as birds their pinions closing,\
> > The heart's best feelings gather home.\
> > Then in our souls there seems to languish\
> > A tender grief that is not woe;\
> > And thoughts that once wrung groans of anguish\
> > Now cause but some mild tears to flow.
> >  
> > And feelings, once as strong as passions,\
> > Float softly back—a faded dream;\
> > Our own sharp griefs and wild sensations,\
> > The tale of others' sufferings seem.\
> > Oh! when the heart is freshly bleeding,\
> > How longs it for that time to be,\
> > When, through the mist of years receding,\
> > Its woes but live in reverie!
> >  
> > And it can dwell on moonlight glimmer,\
> > On evening shade and loneliness;\
> > And, while the sky grows dim and dimmer,\
> > Feel no untold and strange distress—\
> > Only a deeper impulse given\
> > By lonely hour and darkened room,\
> > To solemn thoughts that soar to heaven\
> > Seeking a life and world to come.

>  
> > Flattering Hope, away and leave me,\
> > She'll not come, thou dost deceive me;\
> > Hark the cock crows, th' envious light\
> > Chides away the silent night;\
> > Yet she comes not, oh ! how I tire\
> > Betwixt cold fear and hot desire.
> >  
> > Here alone enforced to tarry\
> > While the tedious minutes marry,\
> > And get hours, those days and years,\
> > Which I count with sighs and fears\
> > Yet she comes not, oh! how I tire\
> > Betwixt cold fear and hot desire.
> >  
> > Restless thoughts a while remove\
> > Unto the bosom of my love,\
> > Let her languish in my pain,\
> > Fear and hope, and fear again;\
> > Then let her tell me, in love's fire,\
> > What torment's like unto desire?
> >  
> > *__Endless wishing, tedious longing,\
> > Hopes and fears together thronging;\
> > Rich in dreams, yet poor in waking,\
> > Let her be in such a taking:\
> > Then let her tell me in love's fire,\
> > What torment's like unto desire?__*

> ## Despair by H.P.Lovecraft
>  
> > O’er the midnight moorlands crying,\
> > Thro’ the cypress forests sighing,\
> > In the night-wind madly flying,\
> > Hellish forms with streaming hair;\
> > In the barren branches creaking,\
> > By the stagnant swamp-pools speaking,\
> > Past the shore-cliffs ever shrieking;\
> > Damn’d daemons of despair.
> >  
> > Once, I think I half remember,\
> > Ere the grey skies of November\
> > Quench’d my youth’s aspiring ember,\
> > Liv’d there such a thing as bliss;\
> > Skies that now are dark were beaming,\
> > Gold and azure, splendid seeming\
> > Till I learn’d it all was dreaming—\
> > Deadly drowsiness of Dis.
> >  
> > But the stream of Time, swift flowing,\
> > Brings the torment of half-knowing—\
> > Dimly rushing, blindly going\
> > Past the never-trodden lea;\
> > And the voyager, repining,\
> > Sees the wicked death-fires shining,\
> > Hears the wicked petrel’s whining\
> > As he helpless drifts to sea.
> >  
> > Evil wings in ether beating;\
> > Vultures at the spirit eating;\
> > Things unseen forever fleeting\
> > Black against the leering sky.\
> > Ghastly shades of bygone gladness,\
> > Clawing fiends of future sadness,\
> > Mingle in a cloud of madness\
> > Ever on the soul to lie.
> >  
> > *__Thus the living, lone and sobbing,\
> > In the throes of anguish throbbing,\
> > With the loathsome Furies robbing\
> > Night and noon of peace and rest.\
> > But beyond the groans and grating\
> > Of abhorrent Life, is waiting\
> > Sweet Oblivion, culminating\
> > All the years of fruitless quest.__*

> ## Think Of It Not Sweet One by John Keats
>  
> > Think not of it, sweet one, so;---\
> >       Give it not a tear;\
> > Sigh thou mayst, and bid it go\
> >       Any---anywhere.
> >  
> > Do not lool so sad, sweet one,---\
> >       Sad and fadingly;\
> > Shed one drop then,---it is gone---\
> >       O 'twas born to die!
> >  
> > Still so pale? then, dearest, weep;\
> >       Weep, I'll count the tears,\
> > And each one shall be a bliss\
> >       For thee in after years.
> >  
> > Brighter has it left thine eyes\
> >       Than a sunny rill;\
> > And thy whispering melodies\
> >       Are tenderer still.
> >  
> > Yet---as all things mourn awhile\
> >       At fleeting blisses,\
> > E'en let us too! but be our dirge\
> >       A dirge of kisses.

> ## 1914 by Wilfred Owen
>  
> > War broke: and now the Winter of the world\
> > With perishing great darkness closes in.\
> > The foul tornado, centred at Berlin,\
> > Is over all the width of Europe whirled,\
> > Rending the sails of progress. Rent or furled\
> > Are all Art's ensigns. Verse wails. Now begin\
> > Famines of thought and feeling. Love's wine's thin.\
> > The grain of human Autumn rots, down-hurled.
> >  
> > For after Spring had bloomed in early Greece,\
> > And Summer blazed her glory out with Rome,\
> > An Autumn softly fell, a harvest home,\
> > A slow grand age, and rich with all increase.\
> > But now, for us, wild Winter, and the need\
> > Of sowings for new Spring, and blood for seed.

> ## Have You Forgotten by Christina Rossetti
>  
> > Have you forgotten how one Summer night\
> >   We wandered forth together with the moon,\
> >   While warm winds hummed to us a sleepy tune?\
> > Have you forgotten how you praised both light\
> > And darkness; not embarrassed yet not quite\
> >   At ease? and how you said the glare of noon\
> >   Less pleased you than the stars? but very soon\
> > You blushed, and seemed to doubt if you were right.\
> > We wandered far and took no note of time;\
> >   Till on the air there came the distant call\
> > Of church bells: we turned hastily, and yet\
> > Ere we reached home sounded a second chime.\
> >   But what; have you indeed forgotten all?\
> > Ah how then is it I cannot forget?

> ## The Rose by Christina Rossetti
>  
> > The lily has a smooth stalk,\
> >   Will never hurt your hand;\
> > But the rose upon her brier\
> >   Is lady of the land.
> >  
> > There's sweetness in an apple tree,\
> >   And profit in the corn;\
> > But lady of all beauty\
> >   Is a rose upon a thorn.
> >  
> > When with moss and honey\
> >   She tips her bending brier,\
> > And half unfolds her glowing heart,\
> >   She sets the world on fire.

> ## A Complaint by William Wordsworth
>  
> > There is a change—and I am poor;\
> > Your love hath been, nor long ago,\
> > A fountain at my fond heart’s door,\
> > Whose only business was to flow;\
> > And flow it did; not taking heed\
> > Of its own bounty, or my need.
> >  
> > What happy moments did I count!\
> > Blest was I then all bliss above!\
> > Now, for that consecrated fount\
> > Of murmuring, sparkling, living love,\
> > What have I? shall I dare to tell?\
> > A comfortless and hidden well.
> >  
> > A well of love—it may be deep—\
> > I trust it is,—and never dry:\
> > What matter? if the waters sleep\
> > In silence and obscurity.\
> > —Such change, and at the very door\
> > Of my fond heart, hath made me poor.

> >  
> > 'O, what land is the Land of Dreams?\

> >  
> > 'Among the lambs, cloth? d in white,\

> > *__Dear child, I also by pleasant streams\

> >  
> > 'Father, O father! what do we here\

> ##  What Are Heavy by Cristina Rossetti
>  
> > What are heavy? sea-sand and sorrow:\
> > What are brief? today and tomorrow:\

> ## The Lily by William Blake

> ## Adam’s Curse by William Butler Yeats
>  
> > We sat together at one summer's end,\
> > That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,\
> > And you and I, and talked of poetry.\
> > I said, "A line will take us hours maybe;\
> > Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,\
> > Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.\
> > Better go down upon your marrow-bones\
> > And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones\
> > Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;\
> > For to articulate sweet sounds together\
> > Is to work harder than all these, and yet\
> > Be thought an idler by the noisy set\
> > Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen\
> > The martyrs call the world." 
> >  
> > And thereupon \
> > That beautiful mild woman for whose sake\
> > There's many a one shall find out all heartache\
> > On finding that her voice is sweet and low\
> > Replied, "To be born woman is to know—\
> > Although they do not talk of it at school—\
> > That we must labour to be beautiful."\
> > I said, "It's certain there is no fine thing\
> > Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.\
> > There have been lovers who thought love should be\
> > So much compounded of high courtesy\
> > That they would sigh and quote with learned looks\
> > precedents out of beautiful old books;\
> > Yet now it seems an idle trade enough."
> >  
> > *__We sat grown quiet at the name of love;\
> > We saw the last embers of daylight die,\
> > And in the trembling blue-green of the sky\
> > A moon, worn as if it had been a shell\
> > Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell\
> > About the stars and broke in days and years.\
> > I had a thought for no one's but your ears:\
> > That you were beautiful, and that I strove\
> > To love you in the old high way of love;\
> > That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown\
> > As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.__*

> > To-day is ours; we have it here:

> ## Hope by Emily Dickinson
>  
> > 'Hope' is the thing with feathers -\

> ## She Walks in Beauty by Lord Byron
>  
> > She walks in beauty, like the night\
> > Of cloudless climes and starry skies;\
> > And all that’s best of dark and bright\
> > Meet in her aspect and her eyes;\
> > Thus mellowed to that tender light\
> > Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
> >  
> > One shade the more, one ray the less,\
> > Had half impaired the nameless grace\
> > Which waves in every raven tress,\
> > Or softly lightens o’er her face;\
> > Where thoughts serenely sweet express,\
> > How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
> >  
> > And on that cheek, and o’er that brow,\
> > So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,\
> > The smiles that win, the tints that glow,\
> > But tell of days in goodness spent,\
> > A mind at peace with all below,\
> > A heart whose love is innocent!

> ## I Wander Lonely as a Cloud by William Wordsworth
>  
> > I wandered lonely as a cloud\
> > That floats on high o'er vales and hills,\
> > When all at once I saw a crowd,\
> > A host, of golden daffodils;\
> > Beside the lake, beneath the trees,\
> > Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
> >  
> > Continuous as the stars that shine\
> > And twinkle on the milky way,\
> > They stretched in never-ending line\
> > Along the margin of a bay:\
> > Ten thousand saw I at a glance,\
> > Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
> >  
> > The waves beside them danced; but they\
> > Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:\
> > A poet could not but be gay,\
> > In such a jocund company:\
> > I gazed—and gazed—but little thought\
> > What wealth the show to me had brought:
> >  
> > For oft, when on my couch I lie\
> > In vacant or in pensive mood,\
> > They flash upon that inward eye\
> > Which is the bliss of solitude;\
> > And then my heart with pleasure fills,\
> > And dances with the daffodils.

> ## So We'll Go No More a Roving by Lord Byron
>  
> > So, we'll go no more a roving\
> >    So late into the night,\
> > Though the heart be still as loving,\
> >    And the moon be still as bright.
> >  
> > For the sword outwears its sheath,\
> >    And the soul wears out the breast,\
> > And the heart must pause to breathe,\
> >    And love itself have rest.
> >  
> > Though the night was made for loving,\
> >    And the day returns too soon,\
> > Yet we'll go no more a roving\
> >    By the light of the moon.

> ## Funeral Blues by W. H. Auden
>  
> > Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,\
> > Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,\
> > Silence the pianos and with muffled drum\
> > Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.
> >  
> > Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead\
> > Scribbling on the sky the message ‘He is Dead’.\
> > Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,\
> > Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.
> >  
> > *__He was my North, my South, my East and West,\
> > My working week and my Sunday rest,\
> > My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;\
> > I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.
> >  
> > The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,\
> > Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,\
> > Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;\
> > For nothing now can ever come to any good.

> ## I have outlasted all desire by Alexander Pushkin
>  
> > I have outlasted all desire,\
> > My dreams and I have grown apart;\
> > My grief alone is left entire,\
> > The gleamings of an empty heart.
> >  
> > The storms of ruthless dispensation\
> > Have struck my flowery garland numb,\
> > I live in lonely desolation\
> > And wonder when my end will come.

> > Thus on a naked tree-limb, blasted\
> > By tardy winter's whistling chill,\
> > A single leaf which has outlasted\

> >    To sever for years,\
> > Pale grew thy cheek and cold,\

> >  
> > The dew of the morning\
> >    Sunk chill on my brow— \
> > It felt like the warning\
> >    Of what I feel now.\
> > Thy vows are all broken,\
> >    And light is thy fame;\
> > I hear thy name spoken,\
> >    And share in its shame.

> ## Guiltless Heart by Sir Francis Bacon
>  
> > The man of life upright, whose guiltless heart is free\
> > From all dishonest deeds and thoughts of vanity:\
> > The man whose silent days in harmless joys are spent,\
> > Whom hopes cannot delude, nor fortune discontent;\
> > That man needs neither towers nor armor for defense,\
> > Nor secret vaults to fly from thunder's violence:\
> > He only can behold with unaffrighted eyes\
> > The horrors of the deep and terrors of the skies;\
> > Thus scorning all the care that fate or fortune brings,\
> > He makes the heaven his book, his wisdom heavenly things;\
> > Good thoughts his only friends, his wealth a well-spent age,\
> > The earth his sober inn and quiet pilgrimage.
> >  
> > *__About Author__* : Bacon has been called the father of empiricism. His works argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued science could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. Although his most specific proposals about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have a long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of the scientific method. This method was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology.

> #  Tithonus
> > Tithonus was a Trojan prince in Greek mythology, son of King Laomedon of Troy and the water nymph Strymo.
> Eos, the Titan goddess of dawn, kidnapped Tithonus along with Ganymede, in order to make them her lovers. She then asked Zeus to grant Tithonus immortality, but did not think of asking to grant him eternal youth too.
> As a result, Tithonus aged and did not die, resulting in his strength wilting away to the point that he could no longer move his arms. All he could do was babble continuously; in the end, he turned into a cicada, hoping that death would come for him as well.

Until we can push it off the roof back into the reactor, it'll kill anyone who gets near it. You see the roof is in three levels. We've named them. The small one here is Katya, one thousand roentgen per hour. Presume two hours of exposure is fatal. The one on the side, Nina, two thousand roentgen. One hour, fatal.

They tell of the ocean, its seascapes, and the storms the sailors have battled. The English refer to ships as she. A boat isn’t an object but a being in its own right. The experience of sailing at night is similar to the intimacy of writing. Because there is the same abandon, a complete relinquishment: sailing at night is to allow yourself to surrender, to let yourself go. It’s to have absolute faith in your boat, which, like the writer’s pen, sometimes makes you think that it is the one deciding which route to take. But you have to stay on course. Know how to maneuver under a moonless sky that merges with the sea and not allow yourself to be intoxicated by the sensation of flying. When the powerful swell tosses the hull, raises it up, and sweeps it along in eddies of foam. When the words seem to align themselves so perfectly that you almost forget what you are writing about. Then you have to keep your eyes on the faint light coming from the compass. It indicates the direction. The end point that should never be lost from sight."

> > "My friends, no one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything. Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington. Without the assistance of the Divine Being who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail. Trusting in Him who can go with me, and remain with you, and be everywhere for good, let us confidently hope that all will yet be well. To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell." - Able Lincoln on February 11, 1861, the day he left his hometown for Washington
