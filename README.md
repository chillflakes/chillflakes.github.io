# If By Rudyard Kipling

> If you can keep your head when all about you\
>     Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\
> If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\
>     But make allowance for their doubting too;\
> If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\
>     Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\
> Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,\
>     And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise.
>
> If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;\
>     If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;\
> If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\
>     And treat those two impostors just the same;\
> If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken\
>     Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\
> Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\
>     And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools.
>
> If you can make one heap of all your winnings\
>     And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\
> And lose, and start again at your beginnings\
>     And never breathe a word about your loss;\
> If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\
>     To serve your turn long after they are gone,\
> And so hold on when there is nothing in you\
>     Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
>
> *__If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\
>     Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,\
> If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\
>     If all men count with you, but none too much;\
> If you can fill the unforgiving minute\
>     With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,\
> Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\
>     And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!__*


#  Annabel Lee By Edgar Allan Poe

> It was many and many a year ago,\
>    In a kingdom by the sea,\
> That a maiden there lived whom you may know\
>    By the name of Annabel Lee;\
> And this maiden she lived with no other thought\
>    Than to love and be loved by me.
>
> I was a child and she was a child,\
>    In this kingdom by the sea,\
> But we loved with a love that was more than love—\
>    I and my Annabel Lee—\
> With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven\
>    Coveted her and me.
>
> And this was the reason that, long ago,\
>    In this kingdom by the sea,\
> A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\
>    My beautiful Annabel Lee;\
> So that her highborn kinsmen came\
>    And bore her away from me,\
> To shut her up in a sepulchre\
>    In this kingdom by the sea.
>
> The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,\
>    Went envying her and me—\
> Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,\
>    In this kingdom by the sea)\
> That the wind came out of the cloud by night,\
>    Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
>
> *__But our love it was stronger by far than the love\
>    Of those who were older than we—\
>    Of many far wiser than we—\
> And neither the angels in Heaven above\
>    Nor the demons down under the sea\
> Can ever dissever my soul from the soul\
>    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;__*
>
> For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams\
>    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\
> And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes\
>    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\
> And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\
>    Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,\
>    In her sepulchre there by the sea—\
>    In her tomb by the sounding sea.
