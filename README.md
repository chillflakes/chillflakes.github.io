> #  Tithonus
> > Tithonus was a Trojan prince in Greek mythology, son of King Laomedon of Troy and the water nymph Strymo.
> Eos, the Titan goddess of dawn, kidnapped Tithonus along with Ganymede, in order to make them her lovers. She then asked Zeus to grant Tithonus immortality, but did not think of asking to grant him eternal youth too.
> As a result, Tithonus aged and did not die, resulting in his strength wilting away to the point that he could no longer move his arms. All he could do was babble continuously; in the end, he turned into a cicada, hoping that death would come for him as well.
> There was a poem written in 3rd century BC by Greek poet Sappho. They have some Papyrus fragments of it preserved. Another version of it, which I am going to share, was written by Alfred Lord Tennyson.

> > What bears for thee true fruit alone is true.\
> > Prove all things, watch the movement of the world\
> > As down the various ways its tribes are whirled;\
> > Take thou thy stand among the chosen few.\

> > The wise man hearkened to his own soul's voice.\
> > Thus also shalt thou find thy greatest bliss;\
> > To lead where the elect shall follow-this\
> > And this alone is worth a hero's choice.
